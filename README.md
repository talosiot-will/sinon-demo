# Sinon Demo

Testing out the Sinon test double library for javascript.  This was adopted from
[this excellent post](https://www.testim.io/blog/sinon-js-tutorial/) and expanded upon.


## Installation

[Requires node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)

[Requires npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)


Then run the install script

`source ./install`


## Using this test

First I would read the blog post and the test code in `test/`.  You can run them yourself with `./run_tests`
